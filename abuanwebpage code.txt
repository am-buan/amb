INTRODUCTION</h1>


<h2>Who I am</h2>
	
Hi, I’m Anna and in my second year of getting a BFA for film production.  I have already worked on some student theater and film productions. Ultimately I want to work in film and comic production, with a focus on script/screenwriting and direction. 
	
<h2>Background</h2>
	
I’m already interested in web design and digital media (I currently work for UNM’s IT department with a background in graphic design) and hope to utilize it in many areas including having a host for my portfolio and writing. I’m originally from the Chicago area with interests in film, comics, art, video games, science, history, theater, and writing.
